# Mars Rover IoT Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and configuration for our IoT 'Mars Rover' project, developed as part of a master's thesis in IoT. The project includes a rover controlled via a base station, designed for autonomous exploration and data collection with a focus on low power consumption.

## Repository Structure
- `Linebot/`: Code for the Linebot in Microchip Studio.
- `STM32/`: Source files and configurations for the STM32 microcontroller.
- `BLE_Modules/`: Scripts for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules.
- `DASH7/`: DASH7 communication protocol implementation.
- `PinConfig/`: Pin configuration files detailing hardware connections.

## Hardware
- Linebot with XMEGA processor
- STM32 microcontroller
- BLE modules
- DASH7 end node
- Power management

## Software
- STM32 Cude IDE
- Microchip studio
- Arduino IDE
- Grafana
- InfluxDB

## Usage
- Upload the corresponding code to each module: Linebot, STM32, BLE, and DASH7.
- Ensure proper hardware connections as outlined in the `PinConfig/` directory.
